# What is SDLC?
```
->  SDLC - Software Development LifeCycle
->  It is the process that is followed by software industry to Design,Develop,Test to give high qulatity product.
-> Pillars of SDLC : 
 ==> Planning ,Defining ,Desinging ,Building ,Testing ,Deploy
```
## Note:
As a Devops Engineer I am primarily focused on automation and improving the efficency of Building, Testing and the deployment phase. 

## For Example
```
* Building and Devloping the E-commerce application from the website example.com .
* There are different phases before delevering to the custmer.
->Planning 
->Defining 
->Desinging
->Building 
->Testing 
->Deploy
* There are different sections in e-commerce site like men's and women's collections.
* If i need to add a new sections for the kids ==> if we need kids catlog we need to go through the above process.
```
## Where the Devops works and improves this process?
```
->Planning + Requirments -> what the customers need and gather the information
->Defining  -> need to document the information ,which is required for software requirment specification document they will provide the all data as per the planning phase 
->Desinging -> high level design (HLD) , Low Level Design (LLD)
```
### Automation takes place for Devops engineer 
```
->Building  -> Developing 
->Testing   -> testing that is taken in the server and QE(Quality engineer) test server
->Deployment-> After testing it pushed to production server and then move to customer.

Devops engineer fastens this procees to develeir the  code quickly by ensuring the process where the building, testing, deployment the process are followed without any manual intervension. 
```
